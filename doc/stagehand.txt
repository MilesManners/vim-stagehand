INTRODUCTION						*stagehand*

This plugin provides a single operation.

Take your current visual selection backstage. Once you have it backstage, make
as many edits to it as you want. When you save backstage, all your changes
will come back to the original buffer like you had never left it.

For the real galaxy brain users out there, try combining stagehand with
goyo.vim and limelight.vim. Stagehand provides events for this purpose.

	autocmd! User StagehandEnter Goyo
	autocmd! User StagehandLeave Goyo!

MAPPINGS						*stagehand-mappings*

s or <Plug>CloseCurtains
	Close the curtains on your current visual selection

ISSUES							*stagehand-issues*

Deleting everything backstage and trying to save it while empty breaks it.

The only way to keep undo history from backstage is to save constantly.

The initial filling of backstage can be undone.
